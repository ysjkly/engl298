# RPG: Back to Korea War
* This is a project for sequence 2 of sp22 ENGL 298 of University of Washington.
* It is a simple textual role play game and the character of the player is a civilian of Korea during the Korean War.
* To play the game, please click [this link](https://ysjkly.github.io/engl298/).

## Limitation
* This game cannot include all events happenned to Korean civilians during the Korean War due to the limitation of the my time and proficiency as a beginner of web programming. For more information of the history, you can check the footer appearing on the bottom right of the game page for the current events in the game.
* Maybe caused by the wrong way I did my research or other reasons, information I got about Korean civilians during the war is not very comprehensive, so the paths in the game do not represent all possible choices for Korean civilians at that time.
* While the game is based on historical facts, the events happenned to the character do not always have references in the real world. For example, I did not find information about the routes refugees move to South Korea and thus don't know if they would really pass through some villages if starting from Seoul. Also, the probability of certain events cannot be the same or even similar to that of the real world.

## Purpose
The purpose of this game is to hope that players can feel the difficulty of Korean civilians struggling to survive in the war through this game. As civilians, they could not get enough information about the war around them or know what would happen next. Players can restart the game when it leads to a bad ending but the civilians never had a second chance. Even if they were lucky enough to live through the war, they still lost so many things, such their family members or their homeland.
